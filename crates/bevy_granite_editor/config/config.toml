Welcome! If this is your first time using the editor follow these steps to get a basic scene started.

Step 1. "Shift - A" and select Camera 3D
Step 2. In the side panel find the "Entities" tab and select it
Step 3. Inside the "Entities" tab find the newly created Camera entity from the list and select it
Step 4. Navigate to the "Camera 3D Data" section and select "Is active"
Step 5. Just below that section find the "Components..." dropdown
Step 6. Find "MainCamera" in the dropdown menu and select it via one of two ways:
    - Select the sub category "bevy_granite_core::entities"
    - Search using the top input bar
Step 7. With the MainCamera attached to a Camera entity, you can move around your scene in 3d
Step 8. Add entities via "Shift - A" and attach any components you build in code that are tagged 
    with #[granite_component]
Step 9. Play around in the "Settings" tab and re-arrange your dock layout

Tips:

• You can import multiple OBJs at once!
• Multi-object OBJ's aren't support yet, but if you batch export the meshes with a common origin point you can import and child them to an empty to create complex geo that way
• If your OBJ was exported with the 'usemtl', a material with that same name will be loaded/created
• You can drag and drop nodes inside the "Entities" panel to re-parent/re-child
• You can multi-select inside the "Entities" panel
